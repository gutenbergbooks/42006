<h3>ORIGINAL ENGLISH ROYAL LETTERS TO THE GRAND MASTERS OF MALTA.</h3>

<p class="ac">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. ix., p. 101.)</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that the last English royal letters which we
  sent were translations of those from Henry VIII. to L'Isle Adam; and
  finding none recorded of Edward VI., Mary I., Elizabeth, James I, Charles
  I. (or from Cromwell), we come to the reign of Charles II. We have now
  before us ten letters bearing the autograph of this monarch, all of which
  we hope to forward in due course according to their dates. The two of the
  earliest date are as follow. The first was written to introduce the
  English Admiral, Sir Thomas Allen, who had been sent with a squadron into
  the Mediterranean to protect English commerce; and the second, to claim
  from the Order a large amount of property which belonged to Roger Fowke,
  the English consul at Cyprus, and had been seized by a Maltese commander
  in one of his cruises against the Turks in the neighbourhood of that
  island. Their perusal will serve to show the deep interest taken by
  Charles II. in all which related to the commercial affairs or legal
  rights of his subjects.</p>

  <p>Most illustrious and most high Prince, our well-beloved cousin and

  <p>Having deemed it fitting to despatch a squadron of ships under the
  command of our well-beloved and valiant Sir Thomas Allen, Knight, for the
  protection of the freedom of navigation and commerce of our subjects in
  the Mediterranean Sea, which is never too sure, and sometimes becomes
  endangered, we have determined to request your highness, by right of
  amity, to permit him and our ships under his command, as friends, to
  touch, in case of need, at any of the coasts of your highness' dominions;
  and also to allow our ships to make use of your highness' harbours,
  whenever it may become necessary to refit or re-victual them; and that
  they may purchase at a proper price those things which they may require,
  and experience such other offices of friendship and humanity as may be
  needful: and as we no way doubt of your highness' amicable feelings
  towards us and ours, we are desirous that your highness should be assured
  that on any opportunity offering, we will reciprocate with equal
  readiness and benevolence.</p>

  <p>It only remains for us to express our wishes for your highness'
  perfect health and prosperous success everywhere.</p>

  <p>To the most illustrious and most high Prince, the Lord Nicholas
  Cottoner, Grand Master of the Order of Malta, our well-beloved cousin and
  friend&mdash;Greeting:</p>

  <p>Most illustrious and most high Prince, our well-beloved cousin and
  friend.</p>

  <p>Some years have elapsed since we first addressed letters to your
  highness concerning certain goods and merchandise, to the value of 4500
  pieces of eight, which had been unjustly seized by some of the ships
  which it is customary to despatch annually from your highness' island to
  cruise against the Turks in the neighbourhood of Cyprus, from our subject
  Roger Fowke, a person for many reasons by us well beloved, and our consul
  in the island of Cyprus; and also concerning the sentence which, after
  many delays and much trouble, had been at last unjustly given in favour
  of your people.</p>

  <p>Farther complaints have, however, been received from our subject,
  stating that our letters have had little effect with your highness, and
  that he, already wearied with long expectation, has not had anything
  restored, that his expenses are increasing to a great amount, and that
  little or no hope remains of reparation for his loss.</p>

  <p>Painful, indeed, was it to us to hear our subject relate such
  injustice on the part of the Knights of Malta; we, however, thought is
  right to make it clearly appear that nothing has remained untried to
  bring back to more sane counsels the generous minds of the Maltese; and
  therefore, under the advice of our Privy Council, we deemed proper to
  refer, without loss of time, the complaint of our subject, together with
  the letters which we formerly addressed to your highness, and those which
  your highness latterly wrote to us, to our advocate in our High Court of
  Admiralty, Sir Robert Wyseman, Knight; who, having well considered the
  whole, has expressed his opinion in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have read and seriously pondered the petition of Roger Fowke,
  transmitted to me by your <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page264"></a>{264}</span>Majesty's special mandate; as also the
  letters written by your Majesty to the Grand Master of the Order of Malta
  in favour of the above-mentioned, and those from the said Grand Master in
  reply; and it is evident to me, after mature examination, that your
  Majesty has done so much, and that it is proved that the sentence of the
  Maltese Tribunal against the said Roger Fowke was pronounced contrary to
  right and justice (as is clearly shown in the letters written by your
  Majesty to the Grand Master); that therefore it appears to be incumbent
  on me only to set forth to your Majesty, and to the Lords of the Privy
  Council, whether it be my opinion that sufficient satisfaction has been
  given by the Grand Master's letters to your Majesty, who by the
  above-cited letters demand restitution; and if not, whether in
  consequence it be lawful to your Majesty to grant the so-called letters
  of reprisal, on which subject I beg humbly to submit to your Majesty, and
  to the singular prudence and judgment of the above-mentioned Lords, this
  my opinion; that is to say, that the answers of the Grand Master are so
  far from being in any way satisfactory, that from them it may be easily
  perceived that the above-mentioned Grand Master, although he does not
  deny in express terms reparation for his loss to the above Roger,
  nevertheless does not decree anything certain on this head; from which
  your Majesty may reasonably conclude that the said reparation was
  refused. Nor does it tend to his defence that he asserts that all that
  was done by his tribunal was done by solemn sentence, that the judges
  were men of great reputation, and that it is to be believed that the
  reasons produced by both sides were justly considered; for judicial
  authority is not of the same value as regards foreigners and subjects. It
  is not lawful for subjects to demand a re-examination of the sentence
  pronounced by their superiors, although to foreign princes it entirely
  appertains to make such demand, in cases interesting themselves or their
  subjects; otherwise, if all given sentences were considered as freeing
  nations from reprisals, such decrees might perhaps be obtained in any
  case, even though manifestly unjust; and consequently it is by all agreed
  to be a just cause for reprisals, not only when justice is not rendered,
  but also when in any case, not of a doubtful nature, judgment may have
  been given against right; although certainly, in cases of a doubtful
  nature, the presumption would be in favour of those who may have been
  elected as public judges. Had the Grand Master indicated to your Majesty
  that the said Roger Fowke might have preferred an appeal against the
  sentence pronounced against him to a superior tribunal, and that by the
  negligence of the said Roger the first sentence had become affirmed, in
  that case the remedy demanded by your Majesty would have been untenable;
  but the said Grand Master makes no mention of such appeal: I am therefore
  of opinion that nothing in the law of nations could militate against the
  lawfulness of your Majesty's granting letters of reprisal in the manner
  demanded.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Without doubt the law of nations would warrant our extorting from the
  hands of your highness' subjects, by issuing letters of reprisal, that
  which we have not been able to obtain after so many years by means of the
  letters written in favour of our beloved subject and friend; and the
  deplorable state of the said Roger requires that we should now exact by
  our own authority that which we have in vain sought to obtain by means of
  simple communications. But taking into serious consideration the
  lamentable present state of Christianity, and the daily augmentation of
  the large empire of our common enemy, and how distinguished has been the
  valour of the Maltese knights, always constantly exposing themselves as a
  bulwark to so pertinacious an enemy, it would be very painful to us to be
  compelled to have recourse to reprisals, or to any such severe mode of
  proceeding, for the reparation of the loss. The glory also of the
  Christian name, so often valiantly defended, has caused us willingly to
  believe that we must not yet despair of obtaining from your highness'
  authority that reparation for his loss which our subject hopes to obtain
  by reprisal, and therefore, putting aside the remedy of right, and our
  Privy Council persuading us to milder measures, we have thought proper by
  this letter to seriously request your highness, by that justice which is
  the duty of princes, and of the defenders of Christianity, to deign to
  procure without delay to our trustworthy subject, who has suffered so
  great an injustice from the Maltese Tribunal, and who is exhausted by the
  delays of so many years, full compensation for all his losses, including
  also the amount of his expenses; so that we may never have cause to
  regret that we, putting aside the law of nations, have till now abstained
  from reprisal, and so that henceforth the world may eulogise the Maltese
  as not being less just than valiant.</p>

  <p>We have only now to recommend your highness and all your Knights to
  the most good and most great God.</p>

  of Human Redemption 1668, and of our reign the twentieth.</p>

  <p>Raphael Cottoner, to whom the last letter was addressed, ascended the
  Maltese throne in October, 1663, on the decease of his brother Raphael.
  <!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page265"></a>{265}</span>All historians agree in stating that he
  was a man of a noble carriage, high and honourable character, and withal
  a clever diplomatist. He died in March, 1680, after a happy and glorious
  rule, in the seventy-third year of his age, and seventeenth of his reign.
  The following letter written by him may be of sufficient interest to
  excuse its length. Its perusal will show the great respect which was paid
  by the Order of St. John to an English monarch, and the "incorruptible"
  manner in which justice was administered at this island nearly two
  centuries ago.</p>

<p class="ac">To the King of Great Britain.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Most serene and invincible King:</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A short time since John Ansely, the attorney of Roger Fowke, delivered
  to us your most serene Majesty's gracious letters, in reply to mine
  regarding the affair of the said Roger; from which, not without great
  disturbance of mind, I perceived how incorrectly what had taken place had
  been reported to your Majesty. But my grief was in some measure assuaged
  by your Majesty's continued benignant protection of this my Order;
  through which it came to pass that it was determined to abstain from
  granting the letters of reprisal which it was the opinion of your
  Majesty's advocate in the High Court of Admiralty, inserted in the
  above-mentioned Royal Letters, might have been granted to the aforenamed
  Roger, for which I truly return your Majesty my most sincere and humble
  thanks. The above Roger still claims of right the sum of 4,500 pieces of
  eight, which he asserts had been formerly seized by some armed ships of
  this island; from which sum, together with the expenses incurred, or to
  be incurred, he forms another greater sum of about 24,500, which he also
  claims.</p>

  <p>But as it would sufficiently appear from your Majesty's letter, which
  contains the above-mentioned opinion of the said advocate, and also from
  the verbal report made to me by the said John Ansely, that your Majesty
  felt persuaded that the said Roger had both lost his cause before the
  Judge of the Prize Court, and subsequently been denied an appeal to the
  Supreme Court, and, lastly, that his attorney had been treated with
  violence, rather than under any order of right, I, to confess the truth,
  being much mortified, cannot but endeavour, with all due respect in my
  power, to demonstrate the real state of the case to your Majesty; and
  hope, by a more faithful narrative of all that occurred, to convince your
  Majesty of that equal distribution of justice which in this place is
  constantly observed, both to the inhabitants and foreigners, with
  incorruptible honesty.</p>

  <p>Before, however, beginning to explain the affair from its
  commencement, it behoves me to inform your Majesty, that not only
  subjects of Christian Princes, but Greeks and Armenians, and other
  persons subject to the rule of the Turks, the bitterest enemies of this
  Order, are continually coming to these islands for the purpose of
  instituting or continuing suits at law against the captains of our ships
  and other inhabitants, yet we have never heard from them that justice is
  either denied or refused. I therefore humbly beseech your Majesty to
  consider, and with benignant mind to reflect, what faith ought to be
  given to those who have dared to affirm that any contrary course had been
  pursued or tolerated by me against the said Roger; and the more so, as it
  has been the constant wish of my Order to deserve well of your Majesty's
  subjects, and to take particular care of all foreigners. This we trust
  will be sufficiently shown from the fact of our always having employed
  one of the principal lawyers to undertake the defence of foreigners; not
  indeed altogether gratuitously, but under such laws and restrictions that
  he must remit to them the third part of the usual stipend which it is
  customary to receive from the inhabitants, and even my knights. From
  which it may be concluded how well and how honourably foreigners are
  treated here, and how unlikely it is that justice should be denied to any
  of those who it is proved are favoured with such grace and love.</p>

  <p>But to return to the affair in question, I humbly submit to your
  Majesty, that in the year of our salvation 1661, John, called De St.
  Amand, acting as attorney in the name of the above-mentioned Roger,
  appeared before the aforesaid judge of the Prize Court, demanding the
  restitution of different kinds of merchandise, which he asserted had been
  seized by certain captains of ships; but it not appearing to the said
  judge that he had produced convincing proofs of the fact, they were
  declared inadequate, and not sufficiently legal. From this decision the
  said attorney, as is usual in such controversies, appealed, on the 10th
  of July, 1662, to the Supreme Court of Audience in council, at which I,
  together with the Chief Grand Crosses of my Order, assist; but he
  afterwards of his own accord neglected to follow up said appeal.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, in the year 1665, there appeared another attorney of the
  said Roger furnished with letters from your most serene Majesty, to whom
  I immediately explained that I had no right to order the actual
  restitution of the money demanded; but that if he would act according to
  law, and seek it by a judgment, I promised to give my co-operation, which
  I undoubtedly would have done; so that he might have been permitted by
  the said Court of Audience to recommence the suit, although it had been
  in a former instance deserted. But the attorney having replied that he
  was not furnished with this authority, left the island of his own free
  will and accord.</p>

  <p>From that time no other person has appeared, except the
  above-mentioned John Ansely, who <!-- Page 266 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>{266}</span>recently delivered to
  me your Majesty's above-mentioned letter; which I having thought proper
  to communicate to my Council, I procured that the venerable brethren
  Henry de Estampes Valancay, the Grand Prior of Campania, and Don Gregory
  Caraffa, Prior of Rocella, should be deputed commissioners to examine
  this case. And they having heard what the said Ansely had to say, offered
  to him in any name, and in that of all my Order, an opportunity to make
  an appeal which had been deserted; but the said Ansely, for want of
  proper authority as he stated, did not accept the proposition.</p>

  <p>Such being the case, I reverently submit to your most serene Majesty
  the following arguments, to which I earnestly entreat your Majesty to
  apply your Royal attention, and your Majesty's accustomed serenity and
  clemency.</p>

  <p>In the first place, it is possible that the said Roger may have been
  really deprived of his property; but it does not follow that the proofs
  adduced by him of that fact were perfectly convincing, or entirely in
  accordance with the law. And even if they had been such, they might have
  appeared otherwise to the said judge of the Prize Court; and it is on
  this account that the Superior of Ten rescind the decrees of the Inferior
  Tribunals.</p>

  <p>Secondly, the omission to continue the above-cited appeal, can in no
  way be attributed to the judges of this island; neither is it true that
  any threats were made use of towards the above-mentioned attorney. Such a
  course would have been diametrically opposed to the statutes of my Order;
  neither would its members have dared to act in such a manner, either
  against foreigners or the inhabitants my subjects, without incurring a
  heavy responsibility.</p>

  <p>Finally, as it is impossible for my knights, putting aside the order
  of right, and neglecting the rule of our statutes, to restore to the
  above-mentioned Roger that which he claims, nothing remains in our power
  but to grant him the faculty of again prosecuting his right before the
  above-mentioned Court of Audience as in law so often and earnestly
  offered to the aforenamed attorney. Nor certainly can it be presumed,
  that your Majesty in your clemency and justice can desire anything
  farther. To this conclusion I am the more drawn from the decision of the
  advocate of the Admiralty himself, for he proposes the granting of
  letters of reprisal not for any other reason than that he supposed
  justice had been denied to the said Roger, and that he had been precluded
  from the remedy of a Court of Appeal. This having been an erroneous
  conclusion, the entire foundation of the above-mentioned opinion is
  wholly removed. And it is the more to be hoped that this decision will be
  approved of by your most serene Majesty, as my necessary subjection to
  the Apostolic See and to the Roman Pontiff cannot be unknown to your
  Majesty. From which it necessarily results that so large a sum could not
  be taken arbitrarily or by force from the parties concerned, without
  grave reprehension and prejudice, and also without infringing the forms
  of right as prescribed in the statutes above alluded to.</p>

  <p>Confiding therefore in the singular clemency of your Majesty, I
  entertain a hope that your Majesty, moved by so many and such valid
  reasons, and considering also the high respect of this my Order towards
  your Majesty, will be pleased to direct the said Roger not to prosecute
  his right by other means than by action at law before the said Court of
  Audience. And that he at length will cease to excite the mind of your
  Majesty against the innocent by any such vain and unjust complaints; and
  that he refrain from any more seeking so inopportune and final a remedy
  of right, as the concession of letters of reprisal against an Order
  obediently subject to the wishes of your Majesty, and most ready to do
  anything for the advantage and utility of your Majesty's subjects, as
  those who daily touch at these islands to re-victual or refit their ships
  can testify. And now, in my own name, and in that of my Order, I humbly
  submit all this to your Majesty by these letters, as I shall also do
  shortly by a Nuncio, whom I shall send to your Majesty with the necessary
  documents, in <i>order more clearly to prove the truth of my
  statements</i>.</p>

  <p>In the mean time, most submissively kissing your Majesty's most serene
  hands, I devotedly implore the benignity of the Most High and the Most
  Great God to grant to your Majesty prosperity in all things.</p>

  1669.</p>

  <p>To the most eminent Prince, the Lord Nicholas Cottoner, Grand Master
  of the Order of Malta, our very dear cousin and friend, Greeting:</p>

  <p>We apprehend that long since it must have come to the knowledge of
  your eminence, that a vessel of war of our Royal fleet, named the
  "Sapphire," went ashore some months ago on the coasts of Sicily; and was
  so much damaged, that she became entirely unseaworthy. We have however
  heard, that some guns which belonged to the said ship have been taken to
  the island of Malta, and there preserved. Having, in consequence, ordered
  our well-beloved and faithful subject Rudolf Montague, the Master of the
  Horse of our most serene Consort, and our Minister near his most
  Christian Majesty, to send there some fitting person to inquire after any
  remains of the said wreck, and to depose of them in a manner most
  advantageous to Us, we, as friends, beg your eminence to be pleased to
  interpose your authority; so that the persons already sent, or hereafter
  to be sent by our said Minister, may experience no delays nor
  impediments, but rather find all favour and due aid from each and every
  chief of the arsenal, ports and customs, and other officers to whom it
  may appertain; which we, in a similar case, will endeavour fully to
  reciprocate to your eminence.</p>

  <p>In the mean time we recommend, with all our heart, your eminence to
  the protection of the Most Good and Most Great God.</p>

<h3>FATA MORGANA.</h3>

  <p>Not having met with the following account in any English newspaper, of
  a phenomenon said to have been witnessed quite recently in Germany, I beg
  to send you a translation from the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> (generally
  quoted in England by the name of the <i>Augsburgh Gazette</i>) of
  February 13, detailing, in a communication from Westphalia, the
  particulars of a phenomenon, new, perhaps, to your pages, but by no means
  new to the world.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Westphalia.</span>&mdash;If the east has its <i>Fata
  Morgana</i>, we, in Westphalia, have also quite peculiar natural
  phenomena, which, hitherto, it has been as impossible to explain
  satisfactorily, as to deny. A rare and striking appearance of this
  description forms now the subject of universal talk and comment in our
  province. On the 22nd of last month a surprising prodigy of nature was
  seen by many persons at B√ºderich, a village between Unna and Werl.
  Shortly before sunset, an army, of boundless extent, and consisting of
  infantry, cavalry, and an enormous number of waggons, was observed to
  proceed across the country in marching order. So distinctly seen were all
  these appearances, that even the flashing of the firelocks, and the
  colour of the cavalry uniform, which was white, could be distinguished.
  This whole array advanced in the direction of the wood of Schafhauser,
  and as the infantry entered the thicket, and the cavalry drew near, they
  were hid all at once, with the trees, in a thick smoke. Two houses, also,
  in flames, were seen with the same distinctness. At sunset the whole
  phenomenon vanished. As respects the fact, government has taken the
  evidence of fifty eye witnesses, who have deposed to a universal
  agreement respecting this most remarkable appearance. Individuals are not
  wanting who affirm that similar phenomena were observed in former times
  in this region. As the fact is so well attested as to place the
  phenomenon beyond the possibility of successful disproof, people have not
  been slow in giving a meaning to it, and in referring it to the great
  battle of the nations at Birkenbaum, to which the old legend,
  particularly since 1848, again points."</p>

<h3>ON THE DESTRUCTION OF MONUMENTAL BRASSES.</h3>

  <p>Any person might naturally be led to suppose, on seeing the many
  costly and learned works which, within the last few years, have appeared
  on the subject of monumental brasses, that their value was now fully
  appreciated, and that all due care was taken to ensure their
  preservation, or at least prevent their wanton destruction. But,
  unhappily, such is far from being the case; and though rubbings of
  brasses are to be found in every antiquarian society, and in the
  possession of very many private individuals, the churchwardens and other
  parties on whom their preservation principally depends, are for the most
  part wilfully blind to their importance as historical memorials, and with
  impunity allow them to be mutilated or stolen. In many of our country,
  and I may also add town churches, are these interesting records of the
  dead stowed away as useless lumber in the vestry, or hidden by some ugly
  modern pew. The writer wishes to make known, through the medium of your
  valuable journal, some instances which have fallen under his own
  observation, in the hope that those who read may make some exertions to
  rectify such acts of desecration were they have already occurred, and to
  prevent their future recurrence.</p>

  <p>To begin, then, with the most important as regards the loss incurred
  by the antiquary, though all show an equal want of good feeling and
  neglect of things sacred, I will first offer the substance of a few notes
  taken during a recent excursion to Cobham, Kent. The brasses in this
  church have long been noted as presenting some of the most interesting
  early examples of this species of monument, extending from the year 1320
  to 1529. They exemplify almost every variety of costume that prevailed
  during that period, executed with the most artistic skill, and
  accompanied with the most elegant accessories in the shape of canopies,
  brackets, and allegorical designs. Imagine, then, the feelings of the
  antiquary, who, upon approaching the chancel where most of these brasses
  lie, finds that it is flooded with water! The roof has gradually fallen
  to decay, and the Earl of Darnley, whose property the chancel is, has
  refused to repair it. And yet this same nobleman can spend thousands of
  pounds in adorning his seat, Cobham Hall, the ancient domain of the
  family, in whose commemoration most of these brasses are laid down. I may
  also here mention that part of the rood-screen which forms the back of
  the earl's pew has been glazed, in order, I suppose, to keep out the damp
  of the chancel, while a portion on the other side has been entirely cut
  away. This is by far the most flagrant case of neglect which I have ever
  witnessed; but there are several minor instances which well demand
  exposure. At Mendlesham, Suffolk, is a fine large figure of John Knyvet,
  Esq., in armour, almost entirely concealed by a pew passing up the whole
  length of the brass. Now, for a very little expense, the slab might be
  removed and laid down again the chancel. At Polstead, in the same county,
  is a small brass of a civilian and family, date about 1490, hidden in the
  same manner; and a figure of a priest in the chasuble, lying loose in the
  vestry. Also at Little Waldingfield is a brass in memory of Robert
  Appleton and wife, 1526, of which the male figure is covered by a pew. In
  Upminster Church, Essex, were found, not very long since, during the
  progress of some alterations, two loose female figures under the flooring
  of a pew, which are still left to be tossed about in the vestry. One is
  an elegant figure of a lady in heraldic mantle and horned head-dress,
  with a dog at her feet, date about 1450, the other about 1630. At St.
  James's, Colchester, the head of a figure was long left loose, till at
  last it has been stolen. And, to conclude, pews have lately been built
  over two brasses at Margate, one of which is an early example of a
  skeleton. To these instances, which have fallen under my own observation,
  I doubt not that every collector can add several others of the same
  description; but these are sufficient to show the wide extent of the
  evil, and the necessity of correction.</p>

<h3>ORIGINAL LETTER OF THE COUNTESS OF BLESSINGTON TO SIR WILLIAM DRUMMOND.</h3>

  <p><span class="sc">My dear Sir William Drummond.</span>&mdash;The
  perusal of your beautiful poem <i>Odin</i> has delighted me so much, that
  I cannot deny myself the gratification of expressing my thanks to its
  author; and at the same time demanding, why so exquisite a poem remains
  unfinished?</p>

  <p>It is cruel to your readers, and unjust to England, to leave such a
  work incomplete; it is like the unfinished statues of Michael Angelo,
  which no hand has ever been found hardy enough to touch, for I am
  persuaded that we have no living poet who could write a sequel to
  <i>Odin</i>.</p>

  <p>Do not think me presumptuous for venturing to give my opinion on
  poetry; I have studied it from my infancy, and my admiration for it is so
  enthusiastic, that I feel more strongly than I can reason on the subject.
  With this passion for poetry, you can more easily imagine than I can
  describe, the delight that <i>Odin</i> gave me. I have copied many
  passages from it in my Album under different heads: such as
  Contemplation; Love of Country; Liberty; Winter; Morning; Meditation on a
  Future State; Immortality of the Soul; Superstition; Vanity of Life;
  Jealousy; and many others too numerous to mention. And they are of such
  transcendent merit, as to be above all comparison, except with Shakspeare
  or <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>{269}</span>Milton. In the sublimity and harmony of
  your verses, you have equalled, if not surpassed, the latter; and in
  originality of ideas and variety, you strikingly resemble the former; but
  neither call boast of anything superior to your beautiful episode of
  "Skiold and Nora."</p>

  <p>Hitherto, my dear Sir William Drummond, I have looked on you as one of
  the first scholars and most elegant prose writers of the age; but, at
  present, permit me to say that I regard you as the <i>first poet</i>.</p>

  <p>When I have been charmed with the productions of writers, who were
  either personally unknown to me, or unhappily dead, how have I regretted
  not being able to pour out my thanks for the pleasure they had afforded
  me: in this instance I rejoice that I have the happiness of knowing you,
  and of being able to express, though feebly, the admiration with which
  your genius inspires me; and of offering up my fervent prayers that you
  may be long spared to adorn and do honour to the age which is, and ought
  to be, proud to claim you. In writing to you I abandon my pen to the
  guidance of my heart, which feels with all the warmth for which <i>Irish
  hearts</i> are so remarkable. A <i>poet</i> can understand and pardon
  this Irish warmth, though a <i>philosopher</i> might condemn it; but in
  addressing you, I forget that I am writing to one of the most eminent of
  the last class, and only remember that I am talking of <i>Odin</i> to the
  most admirable of the first.</p>

  <p>I am at present reading <i>Academical Questions</i>, which, if <i>I
  dare</i> take possession of, should not again find their way to Chiaja;
  <i>Odin</i> I shall most <i>unwillingly</i> resign, as I find it belongs
  to Lady Drummond; but if you have any other of your works by you, will
  you have the goodness to lend them to me? Pray name what day you will
  dine with us, accompanied by Mr. Stewart, to whom I owe my best
  acknowledgments for having lent me <i>Odin</i>.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>The late Judge Talfourd.</i>&mdash;Some years since I ventured to
  request information as to the proper way of pronouncing the <i>Elia</i>,
  from the talented and kind-hearted Judge Talfourd, whose days have just
  been brought to a close under such truly awful circumstances. The ready
  reply which he gave to an unknown inquirer, whilst it illustrates the
  courtesy and cordiality of his character, may prove interesting to your
  readers.</p>

  </div>

  <p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
  11th, and to express my pleasure at finding that you sympathise with me
  in genial admiration of the delightful person to whom it refers. All I
  know respecting the signature of <i>Elia</i> will be found at p. 65 of
  the second volume of Lamb's Letters. It was the real name of a
  coxcombical clerk thirty years dead, whom Lamb remembered at the South
  Sea House, and prefixed to his first essay (which was on the "Old South
  Sea House") in the <i>London Magazine</i>. The editor afterwards used it
  to distinguish Lamb's articles, and he finally adopted it. The <i>i</i>
  is short (<i>El&#x12D;a</i>). It is an Italian name.</p>

  <p><i>Authors' Trustee Society.</i>&mdash;Authors, as a class, are
  perhaps the most unfit men in the world to make the most of their own
  property; and were they ever so competent, it will often happen that
  their works do not attain to any great value as copyrights till after the
  poor author is laid in his grave. It is then, when his family are
  sometimes exposed to severe distress, that more favourable terms might be
  obtained from publishers; but there is no one left who is capable of
  acting for the benefit of the widow or children.</p>

  <p>A Society might be formed to take charge as trustees of the property
  of an author in his works, to make engagements with booksellers for the
  privilege of publishing future editions as they may be required, and to
  take care that the <i>honorarium</i> for each edition be duly paid into
  the hands of the person who is entitled to receive it.</p>

  <p>No expense would attend the formation of such a Society. Its meetings
  could be held at scarcely any cost. The advertisements, to announce from
  time to time what works are open for offers from printers, booksellers,
  and publishers, would amount to a very small sum in the course of the
  year&mdash;I dare say the Editor of "N. &amp; Q." would insert them
  gratuitously. But, if necessary, a small percentage on the fees paid
  would cover all the disbursements of the Society.</p>

  <p><i>The Old Clock at Alderley.</i>&mdash;In the investigation of this
  very old and curious piece of mechanism by the Rev. Joseph Bockett, in
  the year 1833, an inscription was found signifying that it was presented
  to the church of Alderley by the great Sir Matthew Hale. It was copied,
  <i>verbatim</i> <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  gentleman, and is as follows:</p>

  Heale to the Parish Church of Alderly. John Mason, Bristol, Fecit,
  Nov&#x113;m. 1<sup>st</sup> 1673."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It appears, by this inscription, to have been presented on his
  birth-day; which, from his tomb, was found to be November 1. Alderley is
  the family place of the Hale family to this day.</p>

  <p>The same distinguished traveller remarks (<i>Classical and Topog. Tour

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was a favourite plan of the learned Winkelmann to raise a
  subscription for the excavation of the Olympic plain. If such a project
  should ever be consummated, we may confidently hope that the finest
  specimens of sculpture, as well as the most curious and valuable remains,
  will be brought to light. No place abounded with such numerous offerings

  <p><i>Irish Law in the Eighteenth Century.</i>&mdash;I send, for the

  Reilly's <i>Dublin News Letter</i>, Aug. 9, 1740:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Last week, at the assizes of Kilkenny, a fellow who was to be tried
  for robbery not pleading, a jury was appointed to try whether he was
  wilfully mute, or by the hands of God; and they giving a verdict that he
  was wilfully mute, he was condemned to be pressed to death. He
  accordingly suffered on Wednesday, pursuant to his sentence, which was as
  follows: that the criminal shall be confined in some low dark room, where
  he shall be laid on his back, with no covering except round his loins,
  and shall have as much weight laid upon him as he can bear, and more;
  that he shall have nothing to live upon but the worst bread and water;
  and the day that he eats, he shall not drink; and the day that he drinks,
  he shall not eat; and so shall continue till he dies."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Is it to be believed that, so late as the 1740, such barbarity (to
  call it nothing worse) was practised according to law within the limits
  of Great Britain and Ireland? I would be glad to hear from some
  correspondent upon the subject.</p>

  <p><i>Gravestone Inscriptions.</i>&mdash;In the churchyard of Homersfield
  (St. Mary, Southelmham), Suffolk, was the gravestone of Robert Crytoft,
  who died Nov. 17, 1810, aged ninety, bearing the following epitaph:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="i1">For nobody cares for thee.</p>

  never seen them elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Paintings of Our Saviour.</i>&mdash;In Mrs. Jameson's <i>Legends of
  the Monastic Orders</i>, it is stated that "The painter, Andrea Vanni,
  was among the devout admirers of St. Catherine;" and that "among his
  works was a head of Christ, said to have been painted under the immediate
  instruction of St. Catherine; representing the Saviour as she had, in her
  visions, beheld him. Unhappily this has perished." Also, on the authority
  of Mr. Sterling, that St. Juan de la Cruz, the friend of St. Theresa, "on
  one occasion when the Saviour appeared to him, made an uncouth sketch of
  the divine apparition; which was long preserved as a relique in the
  Convent of the Incarnation at Avila."</p>

  <p><i>Heraldic.</i>&mdash;Can any of your heraldic correspondents inform
  me to what families the following coat of arms belongs:&mdash;Gules, a
  fess sanguine between three trefoils slipped proper? There is in this the
  not very frequent occurrence of a coloured charge upon a coloured field.
  The only similar instance I now remember is Denham, Suffolk: Gules, a
  cross vert.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Loccan.</span></p>

  <p><i>Dedication of Kemerton Church.</i>&mdash;The church at Kemerton,
  Gloucestershire, was, until a few years ago, marked by the authorities
  with a blank, just as the church of Middleton ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. v., p.
  372.); but it has now been discovered, it would appear, to have been
  dedicated to <i>St. Nicholas</i>. How, or where?</p>

  <p class="author">I. R. R.</p>

  <p><i>Consolato del Mare.</i>&mdash;The maritime code of the Venetians
  derived from Barcelona, observed also by the Genoese and Pisans, was
  called "Consolato del Mare," <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1200. Why was
  it so called?</p>

  <p class="author">R. H. G.</p>

  <p><i>Consonants in Welsh.</i>&mdash;It has often been asserted that the
  Welsh language is remarkable for the number of its consonants. Can any of
  your readers acquainted with that language inform me whether there is a
  larger proportion of consonants in Welsh than in English? Messrs.
  Chambers, in a recent number of their <i>Repository</i>, say:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On the road to Merthyr, we heard a drunken Welshman swear; oh for
  words to describe the effect! His mouth seemed full of consonants, which
  cracked and cracked, and ground and exploded, in an extraordinary way,"
  &amp;c.</p>

  called an <i>initiative</i>, is indispensably necessary, even to the mere
  semblance of method."&mdash;Coleridge's <i>Treatise on Method</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Am I to understand from this sentence that this word was an original
  adaptation of Coleridge's? If not, when was it first introduced, and by
  whom?</p>

  <p>In the same treatise, Coleridge employs the word <i>psychological</i>,
  and apologises for using an <i>insolens verbum</i>. Was this the first
  occasion of the familiar use of this word? I find <i>psychology</i> in
  Bailey.</p>

  <p><i>Atonement.</i>&mdash;Can you or any of your readers inform me when
  the word "atonement" first came into use, and when it was first applied
  to the work of reconciliation wrought by our Lord Jesus Christ? It is
  used once only in the New Testament (Romans v. 11.), and there the word
  does not quite convey the meaning of the original <span title="katallag√™" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&gamma;&eta;</span>.
  The etymology of it seems so purely English, that one would hardly expect
  to find the present use, or rather adaptation, of the word, so very
  modern as it appears to be.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Stephen Fox.</i>&mdash;Chambers' <i>Journal</i>, No. 515., Nov.

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Charles James Fox, who died in 1806, at the age of fifty-seven, had
  an uncle who was paymaster of the forces in 1679, the year of the battle
  of Bothwell Bridge, and his grandfather was on the scaffold with Charles
  I."</p>

  <p><i>Scottish Female Dress.</i>&mdash;When did ladies cease to use
  hair-powder, face-patches, hoops, and high-heeled shoes? An old lady of
  about seventy recollects perfectly that her mother wore then all (so, she
  thinks, did her visitors, who came to a dish of tea) except the hoop,
  which was reserved for grand occasions. On the introduction of the
  new-fangled low-heeled shoes, she recollects her mother tottering about
  on them like a novice on skates, and groaning with pains in her legs, a
  victim to a change of fashion! At this time, she adds, was in every-day
  use the <i>milk tally</i> and <i>bread-nick-stick</i>. The first, that
  represented in Hogarth's picture; the second, a stick about a foot long,
  four-sided, on which each loaf was registered by a notch or nick in the
  stick; the servant kept a similar <i>nick-stick</i> as a check on the
  baker; but during the flirtation, common <i>then</i> as <i>now</i> on
  such occasions, the old lady slyly remarks, the baker often gallantly
  nicked the check-stick, as well as his own, with a couple of notches for
  one. Hence, possibly, the decline and fall of the use of this wooden
  system of book-keeping by double notch. Is any date assigned to the
  ceasing of the practice of using the wooden tally and nick-stick?</p>

  sixteen years, took the degrees in Arts, that of Master being completed
  1620, holy orders, and at length was made vicar of Clifton in

  <p>"It is well known to all who are conversant in electrical experiments,
  that the electric power may be propagated along a small wire, from one
  place to another, without being sensibly abated by the length of its
  progress. Let, then, a set of wires, equal in number to the letters of
  the alphabet, be extended horizontally between too given places, parallel
  to one another, and each of them about an inch distant from that next to
  it. At every twenty yards' end let them be fixed in glass, or jeweller's
  cement, to some firm body, both to prevent them from touching the earth,
  or any other non-electric, and from breaking by their own gravity. Let
  the electric gun-barrel be placed at right angles with the extremities of
  the wires, and about an inch below them; also let the wires be fixed in a
  solid piece of glass at six inches from the end; and let that part of
  them which reaches from the glass to the machine have sufficient spring
  and stiffness to recover its situation after having been brought in
  contact with the barrel. Close by the supporting glass let a ball be
  suspended from every wire, and about a sixth or an eighth of an inch
  below the ball place the letters of an alphabet, marked on bits of paper,
  or any other substance that may be light enough to rise to the
  electrified ball, and at the same time let it be so contrived that each
  of them may reassume its proper place when dropt. All things constructed
  as above, and the minute previously fixed, I begin the conversation with
  my distant friend in this manner:&mdash;Having set the electrical machine
  a-going, as in ordinary experiments, suppose I am to pronounce the word
  <i>sir</i>; with a piece of glass, or any other <i>electric per se</i>, I
  strike the wire <i>s</i>, so as to bring it in contact with the barrel,
  then <i>i</i>, then <i>r</i>, all in the same way; and my correspondent,
  almost in the same instant, observes these several characters rise in
  order to the electrified balls at his end of the wires. Thus I spell away
  as long as I think fit, and my correspondent, for the sake of memory,
  writes the characters as they rise, and may join or read them afterwards
  as often as he inclines. Upon a signal given, or from desire, I stop the
  machine, and taking up the pen, in my turn I write down whatever my
  friend at the other end strikes out.</p>

  <p>"If anybody should think this way tiresome, let him, instead of the
  balls, suspend a range of bells from the roof, equal in number to the
  letters of the alphabet, gradually decreasing in size from the bell
  <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>; and from the horizontal wires let there be another
  set reaching to the several bells; one, viz., from the horizontal wire
  <i>a</i> to the bell <i>a</i>, another from the horizontal wire <i>b</i>
  to the bell <i>b</i>, &amp;c. Then let him who begins the discourse bring
  the wires in contact with the barrel, as before, and the electric spark,
  breaking on bells of different size, will inform his correspondent by the
  sound what wires have been touched. And thus, by some practice, they may
  come to understand the language of the chimes in whole words, without
  being put to the trouble of noting down every letter.</p>

  <p>"The same thing may be otherwise effected. Let the balls be suspended
  over the characters, as before, but instead of bringing the ends of the
  horizontal wires in contact with the barrel, let a second set reach from
  the electrificator, so as to be in contact with the horizontal ones; and
  let it be so contrived, at the same time, that any of them may be removed
  from its corresponding horizontal by the slightest touch, and may bring
  itself again into contact when left at liberty. This may be done by the
  help of a small spring and slider, or twenty other methods which the
  least ingenuity will discover. In this way the characters will always
  adhere to the balls, excepting when any of the secondaries is removed
  from contact with its horizontal; and then the letter at the other end of
  the horizontal will immediately drop from its ball. But I mention this
  only by way of variety.</p>

  <p>"Some may perhaps think that, although the electric fire has not been
  observed to diminish sensibly in its progress through any length of wire
  that has been tried hitherto; yet, as that has never exceeded some thirty
  or forty yards, it may be reasonably supposed, that in a far greater
  length it would be remarkably diminished, and probably would be entirely
  strained off in a few miles by the surrounding air. To prevent this
  objection, and save longer argument, lay over the wires, from one end to
  the other, with a thin coat of jeweller's cement. This may be done for a
  trifle of additional expense; and as it is an electric <i>per se</i>,
  will effectually secure any part of the fire from mixing with the
  atmosphere.</p>

<h3>FACTITIOUS PEDIGREES: DIXON OF BERSTON.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 221.)</p>

  <p>The inquiry of <span class="sc">Mr. R. W. Dixon</span> is one that I
  feel should not remain unanswered; and a few circumstances that I can
  detail will be sufficient to prove that his brother Mr. J. H. Dixon only
  exercised a just discretion in rejecting the information offered by
  William Sidney Spence.</p>

  <p>On 4th March, 1848 (a few months, therefore, earlier than the letter
  which has been quoted), a communication was forwarded to me by Mr. Spence
  so similar, as to warrant the supposition that a set form was kept on
  hand to be copied in different applications with such variations as each
  case might demand, though even then a discrepancy has crept in that would
  render the evidence suspicious.</p>

  <p>The first paragraph is the same, except that Mr. Spence states he was
  engaged by the "<i>widow</i> of Sir John Cotgreave," instead of the
  "<i>sister</i>."</p>

  <p>In the second the pedigree is said to be the "work of Randle Holme,
  1672, from documents by William Camden," instead of the work of "the
  great Camden." Monsons, of course, are substituted instead of Dixons.
  Four generations from Sir John Monson temp. Edward III., instead of five
  generations from Ralph Dixon temp. Henry VI. And this Sir John is slain
  fighting under Lord Audley at the battle of Poictiers, 1356, as a
  counterpart to Ralph Dixon, slain at the battle of Wakefield, 1460.</p>

  <p>The third paragraph is word for word the same, except that, to be
  consistent with the descents, four shields with sixteen quarterings are
  offered instead of five shields with twelve.</p>

  <p>Lady Cotgreave is to vouch for the authenticity instead of Miss
  Cotgreave.</p>

  <p>The quarterings promised in the next paragraph are only partially the
  same, and the conclusion merely differs in wording by the substitution of
  the names of "Sir John Monson" and "his mother Elinor, daughter and
  coheir of Sir John Sutton, de Sutton and Congleton," in place of "Ralph
  Dixon and his mother Maude, daughter and coheiress of Sir Ralph Fitz
  Hugh," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>I acknowledge that from the first I did not believe a word of this
  ingenious tale; in fact I was rather an unfortunate subject for Mr.
  Spence's purpose, having for years made the early history of my family my
  especial study; but having a friend resident at Birkenhead (a clergyman),
  I applied to him out of curiosity to find out something of my informant,
  who at least had shown some ingenuity. The answer was by no means in
  favour of Mr. Spence; and one fact was decidedly ascertained, that he
  neither lived nor was known in Priory Place, whence his letters were
  dated. I answered his letter, declining to give the remuneration of five
  pounds which he had asked; and on taxing him with the falsity of his
  residence, he said he had his letters left there for convenience.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Dixon</span> must now himself judge of the credit
  to be placed on the informant. As for the information in my own case, it
  bore internal proofs of being worthless; and if such a pedigree as is
  described should exist, I feel assured it is not the work of Camden, but
  more probably of a cotemporary, of rather discreditable notoriety among
  genealogists, of the name of Dakyns.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Monson.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Gatton Park.</p>

  <p>I can give no information on the Dixon family, but having some years
  ago received a letter from the same Mr. Spence, with an account of my own
  family, every word of which is not only entirely without authority, but a
  gross invention opposed to the facts, I thought <span class="sc">Mr.
  Dixon</span> might like to know that Mr. Spence founds the romance in
  question on a "Pedigree of Cotgreave de Hargrave, the work of the
  celebrated Randle Holme, anno 1672, from documents compiled by that
  learned antiquary William Camden, in the year 1598," evidently the same

  <p>The following note will, I think, satisfy your correspondent <span
  class="sc">R. W. Dixon</span> that the letter of William Sidney Spence
  which you inserted for him was an imposture, and that Mr. J. H. Dixon was
  not without reason in rejecting the information offered.</p>

  <p>A friend of mine, assuming descent from "a good old" family of the
  same name, which he was unable to prove, received, about the same time as
  <span class="sc">Mr. Dixon</span> did, a communication from Mr. William
  Sidney Spence to precisely the same effect, and having no cautious
  brother to consult, readily took the bait, and paid some pounds for a
  specious pedigree, setting forth his "distinguished progenitors," with
  their armorial bearings, &amp;c., purporting to be authenticated as a
  true copy of one in Miss Cotgreave's possession under that lady's own
  hand. The information so received being subsequently submitted to a
  genealogical friend, some doubt was excited of its genuineness in proving
  too much; and an inquiry, which I made through a correspondent in
  Cheshire, tending to confirm this suspicion, a reference was had to Miss
  Cotgreave herself, when it turned out that the whole was an ingenious
  fabrication. Mr. Spence was then dead, and my friend, whose name I do not
  mention, as the subject is rather a sore one, was obliged to be content
  with the practical experience he had bought.</p>

  <p>The probability is, that whenever Mr. Spence read in Burke's <i>Landed
  Gentry</i> that Mr. A. or <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page276"></a>{276}</span>Mr. B., in preference to being considered
  as the founder of a new family, supposed himself, or wished to be
  supposed by others, to be descended from an old stock of the same name,
  he kindly offered to supply the desired information, and was ready to
  execute a pedigree to order.</p>

  information respecting his family taken from the Cotgreave pedigree, and
  who imprudently sent money for the same, got nothing but the most absurd
  rubbish in return, and having been induced to make inquiries into the
  subject, was fully satisfied that the whole thing was a fraud.]</p>

  <p>There can, I think, be little doubt that <i>Stansstede</i>, in <span
  class="sc">Mr. J. H. Parker's</span> list, is Stanstead Hall, near
  Halstead in Essex. I have never seen Stanstead Hall, but about a month
  since I was in company with the late occupant; from whom I learned, in
  casual conversations, that it was an ancient house, with moat and
  fortifications. In addition to this I may state, that there are monuments
  in the old church (St. Andrew) of Halstead to some of the Bourchier
  family. These facts, taken together, seem to fix the locality with
  sufficient precision. One of the monuments just referred to is a brass,
  commemorating Sir Bartholomew Bourchier and his two wives; which, when I
  copied it in 1847, was under the flooring of a pew in the south aisle. He
  died May 8, 1409; and was previously the possessor of Stanstead Hall: so
  I learn from my own MS. Catalogue of brass rubbings in my collection, but
  I am not able to give any better reference to authenticate the
  statement.</p>

  <p><i>Heyheved</i>, mentioned in <span class="sc">Mr. Parker's</span>
  list, is <i>Highhead Castle</i> in Cumberland. In the reign of Edward II.
  it was a <i>peel house</i> (pelum de Heyheved) possessed by Harcla, Earl
  of Carlisle. In modern times it became the property of a family named
  Richmond, one of whom erected the present house, after a plan by Inigo
  Jones. But he died before it was finished, leaving co-heirs, who
  quarrelled about the partition of the estate, and actually put a hedge
  through the centre of the house. Eventually one-half came into the hands
  of Lord Brougham, who is understood to have purchased the other, and will
  probably restore the whole.</p>

<h3>NEWSPAPER FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p>It may be instructive to collate the four stories recorded in the
  above references, and compare them with a case that was brought before
  Mr. Jardine at Bow Street Police Court; and which was reported in <i>The
  Times</i> for February 22, 1854. Let the following extract suffice: it is
  descriptive of the operations of extracting a worm from the body of one
  Harriet Gunton, by a female quack of the name of Jane Browning:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I laid myself on the bed as she desired, and she told Mrs. Jones to
  hold my mouth to prevent my breathing. Mrs. Jones held me from behind,
  and nearly suffocated me. She kept me down, while the prisoner tried to
  get the worms out of my body with her hands. This lasted for about a
  quarter of an hour, and caused me dreadful pain. The prisoner told me
  that one of the worms had bit her finger, and slipped away again, and she
  could not get at it. She tried a second time, and said the worm had bit
  her again. I then begged her to leave off, if she could not succeed in
  getting it away; for I believed I should die under the operation. She
  tried a third time, and said she had broken two skins of it, which would
  prevent it getting up my body. ... She then put her hand under the
  clothes. I felt something touch me like a cloth, and she drew away her
  hand; throwing something into the pan, which sounded <!-- Page 277
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>{277}</span>with a heavy
  splash. She said she had been trying at it all night, and had got it away
  at last."</p>

  <p>Mr. Robert Biggs, the medical attendant, pronounced the "reptile" to

  way.</p>

  <p>It would be well if every popular error were hunted down, as your
  correspondents have done in the case of the snake-vomiting at Portsmouth.
  The public need to be told, that no animal can live in the alimentary
  canal but the parasites which belong to that part of the animal economy.
  Of these the <i>Lumbricus intestinalis</i> is the largest, and is
  discharged by children even of the size mentioned in the case of Jonathan
  Smith.</p>

  <p>Two years ago I met with a curious illustration of the popular
  ignorance of that branch of natural history which treats of our own
  reptiles, as well as of the mode of growth of a popular marvel. During
  the hot weather of the summer before last, I was asked by a respectable
  farmer, if I had seen the "serpent" which was lately killed in an
  adjoining parish. "Serpent!" I replied; "I suppose you mean some
  overgrown common snake&mdash;perhaps a female full of eggs?" "Well, it
  might have been a snake at first, but it was grown into a serpent; and
  pursued a boy through the hedge, but was fortunately encountered and
  killed by the father."</p>

  <p>It is a moot point, whether the parasites of animals are engendered or
  not within the body. In the case of the bots of horses, they are known to
  be the larv√¶ of a fly which deposits its eggs on the skin; from whence
  they are licked off, and conveyed into the animal's stomach, where they
  are hatched and prepared for their other metamorphoses.</p>

  <p>I believe the only parasite taken in with water in tropical climates
  is the Guinea Worm; an animal which burrows under the skin of the arms or
  legs, and is extremely difficult of extraction, and often productive of
  great inconvenience. But whether the egg of this worm be taken into the
  stomach, and conveyed by the blood into the limbs, there to be hatched
  into life, or whether it enter through the pores of the skin, I believe
  is not determined.</p>

  <p>The popular delusion respecting the swallowing of young snakes, and of
  their continuance in the stomach, is a very old one, and is still
  frequent. A medical friend of mine, not long since, was called on to
  treat a poor hysterical woman, who had exhausted the skill of many
  medical men (as she asserted) to rid her of "a snake or some such living
  creature, which she felt confident was and had been for a long time
  gnawing in her stomach." I suggested the expediency of working on the
  imagination of this poor hypochondriac, as was done in the well-known
  facetious story of the man who fancied he had swallowed a cobbler; and
  who was cured by the apparent discharge first of the awls and strap, then
  of the lapstone, and, finally, of Crispin himself.</p>

  <p>"Many great and good men have entertained scruples on the practice of
  interment in churches. The example of the virtuous and primitive
  confessor, Archbishop Sancroft, who ordered himself to be buried in the
  churchyard of Fresingfield in Suffolk, thinking it improper that the
  house of God should be made the repository of sinful man, ought to
  command the imitation of less deserving persons: perhaps it had an
  influence over the mind of his successor, Archbishop Secker, who ordered
  himself to be buried in the churchyard of Lambeth. The Bishops of London
  in succession, from Bishop Compton to Bishop Hayter, who died in 1762,
  inclusive, have been buried in Fulham Churchyard."<a name="footnotetag1"

  <p>Of the same opinion were Dr. Edward Rainbow, Bishop of Carlisle; Sir
  Matthew Hale, who used to say that churches were for the living and to
  churchyards for the dead<a name="footnotetag2"

  "did not hold God's house a meet repository for the greatest saint;" and
  William Bedell, Bishop of Kilmore, who made a canon in his synod to the
  following effect:</p>

  <p>Dr. Isaac Barrow, Bishop of St. Asaph, was buried in a churchyard,
  although, from his having generously repaired and endowed his cathedral,
  he might be considered to have a claim of interment within its walls; and
  Baldwin, the great civilian, severely censures this indecent liberty, and
  questions whether he shall call it a superstition or an impudent
  ambition. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, was the first who made
  vaults under the chancel, and even under the altar, when he rebuilt the
  choir of Canterbury, about 1075.<a name="footnotetag3"

  English, as we find it enjoined in the Council of Cashel, held in 1172,
  mentioned by Cambrensis. A short time since some small earthen tumuli
  were opened on the Curragh of Kildare, under which skeletons were found
  standing upright on their feet, and in their hands, or near them, spears
  with iron heads. The custom of placing their dead erect was general among
  all the northern nations, and is still retained in Lapland and some parts
  of Norway; and the natives of North America bury their dead sitting in
  holes in the ground, and cover them with a mound of

<h3>DO CONJUNCTIONS JOIN PROPOSITIONS ONLY?</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 180.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Professor Boole's</span> communication on the above
  question reminds me of some remarks of mine, published in an article on
  Sir John Stoddart's <i>Philosophy of Language</i>, in the <i>North
  British Review</i> for November, 1850. In reference to the opinion
  maintained by Sir John Stoddart and Dr. Latham, that the conjunction
  always connects sentences, the preposition words, it is observed:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It does not apply to cases where the conjunction unites portions of
  the <i>predicate</i>, instead of the <i>subject</i>, of a proposition. If
  I assert that a gentleman of my acquaintance drinks brandy <i>and</i>
  water, he might not relish the imputation of imbibing separate potations
  of the neat spirit and the pure element. Stradling <i>versus</i> Stiles
  is a case in point: 'Out of the kind love and respect I bear to my much
  honoured and good friend, Mr. Matthew Stradling, Gent., I do bequeath
  unto the said Matthew Stradling, Gent., <i>all my black and white
  horses</i>.' The testator had six black horses, six white horses, and six
  pied horses. The whole point at issue turns upon the question whether the
  copulative <i>and</i> joins sentences or words. If the former, the
  plaintiff is entitled to the black horses, and also to the <!-- Page 280
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>{280}</span>white, but not
  to the pied. If the latter he has a right to the pied horses but must
  forego his claim to the rest. And if the latter interpretation be
  adopted, must we say that <i>and</i> is a preposition, not a conjunction,
  or must we modify the definitions of these two parts of speech?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following definitions are finally proposed in place of the
  ordinary ones:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A preposition is a part of speech annexed to a noun or verb in a
  proposition, and serving to connect it with a noun or pronoun by which it
  is limited, as the subject or predicate of that proposition."</p>

  <p>"A conjunction is a part of speech serving to unite two propositions
  as parts of the same complex assertion, or two words as similar parts of
  the subject or predicate of one proposition. By <i>similar parts</i> it
  is meant that the words so united stand in similar relations to the term
  to which they belong. For example, 1. As attributes, both qualifying a
  subject, 'Sic bonus et sapiens dignis ait esse paratus.' 2. As
  prepositions, both introducing limiting nouns 'without money and without
  price.' 3. As substantives, both forming parts of a collective subject,
  'two and three are five.' Whereas with the preposition, the words united
  are not similar, but opposed, the <i>limiting</i> and the <i>limited</i>
  notion."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>While differing from some of <span class="sc">Professor Boole's</span>
  views on the relation of logic to mathematics, I fully agree with him
  that the true functions of the several parts of speech must be determined
  by an analysis of the laws of thought. Both grammar and logic might be
  considerably improved by an accurate development on psychological
  principles.</p>

  <p>Has not your correspondent <span class="sc">G. Boole</span> fallen
  into an inaccuracy whilst contending about the accuracy of another's
  logic? He seems to employ the proposition, <i>all trees are endogens or
  exogens</i>, as an example of an accurate proposition.</p>

  <p>I forget the technicalities in which the objection to such a
  proposition would be properly expressed; but it cannot well be denied
  that <i>all</i> comprehends the whole genus, and expresses that whole
  collectively. If so, the proposition affirms that the whole genus of
  trees must either be acknowledged to be endogens, or else to be
  <i>all</i> exogens. Does not such an affirmation require the word
  <i>every</i> to clear it from ambiguity? Will it be cleared of ambiguity
  by saying, "Every tree is endogen or exogen?" Or must we say "Every tree
  is either endogen or exogen?"</p>

  to unravel, of which I would gladly see their solution. For he has there
  said, "Three Bobaques are all true and real Bobaques, supposing the name
  of that species of animals belongs to them." Is this name formed in jest?

<h3>HAS EXECUTION BY HANGING BEEN SURVIVED?</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 174.)</p>

  <p>Two instances of criminals being restored to life after having been
  hanged are recorded, on good authority, to have occurred in this town.
  Henry of Knighton (who was a Canon of Leicester Abbey) relates in his
  <i>Chronicle</i> (col. 2627), under the year 1363, that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"One Walter Wynkeburn having been hanged at Leicester, on the
  prosecution of Brother John Dingley, Master of Dalby, of the order of
  Knights Hospitallers, after having been taken down from the gallows as a
  dead man, was being carried to the cemetery of the Holy Sepulchre of
  Leicester, to be buried, began to revive in the cart, and was taken into
  the church of the Holy Sepulchre by an ecclesiastic, and there diligently
  guarded by this Leicester ecclesiastic to prevent his being seized for
  the purpose of being hanged a second time. To this man King Edward
  granted pardon in Leicester Abbey, and gave him a charter of pardon, thus
  saying in my hearing, 'Deus tibi dedit vitam, et nos dabimus tibi
  Cartam?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We learn, on the authority of a cotemporary record, preserved in the
  archives of this borough, and quoted in Thompson's <i>History of
  Leicester</i>, p. 110., that in June, 1313, Matthew of Enderby, a thief,
  was apprehended and imprisoned in the king's gaol at Leicester; and that
  being afterwards convicted, he was sentenced by Sir John Digby and Sir
  John Daungervill, the king's justices, to be hanged; that he was led to
  the gallows by the frankpledges of Birstall and Belgrave, and by them
  suspended; but on his body being taken down, and carried to the cemetery
  of St. John's Hospital for interment, he revived and was subsequently
  exiled. Three instances are narrated in Wanley's <i>Wonders of Man</i>,
  vol. i. pp. 125, 126., and another will be found in Seward's <i>Spirit of
  Anecdote and Wit</i>, vol. iii. p. 88., quoted from Gamble's <i>Views of
  Society, &amp;c. in the North of Ireland</i>; whilst in vol. ii. p. 220.
  of the same work, another restoration to life is stated to have taken
  place in the dissecting-room of Professor Junker, of Halle: but I know
  not how far these last-mentioned anecdotes are susceptible of proof.</p>

  <p>There appears to be no reason to doubt the truth of individuals having
  survived execution by hanging.</p>

  <p>Margaret Dickson was tried, convicted, and executed in Edinburgh, in
  the year 1728. After <!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page281"></a>{281}</span>the sentence had been accomplished, her
  body was cut down and delivered to her friends, who placed it in a
  coffin, and conveyed the same in a cart towards her native place for the
  purpose of interment. On her journey the dead came to life again, sat up
  in her coffin, and alarmed her attendants. She was, however, promptly
  bled, and by the next morning had perfectly recovered. She lived for
  twenty-five years afterwards, and had several children.</p>

  <p>In 1705 one John Smith was executed at Tyburn; after he had hung
  fifteen minutes a reprieve arrived. He was cut down and bled, and is said
  to have recovered. (Paris and Fonblanque, <i>Med. Jur.</i>, vol. ii. p.
  92.)</p>

  <p>When it is considered that death takes place after hanging, in most
  cases by asphyxia, in very rare instances by dislocation of the spine, we
  can understand the possibility of recovery within certain limits.</p>

  <p>That artificial means have been adopted to ensure recovery, the case
  of Gordon, which occurred in the early part of the seventeenth century,
  satisfactorily establishes.</p>

  <p>This evil-doer had been condemned for highway robbery, and with a view
  to escape from his penalty, succeeded in obtaining the following friendly
  assistance.</p>

  <p>A young surgeon named Chovell (concerning whose motives we will not
  inquire too curiously) introduced a small tube through an opening which
  he made in the windpipe. The hangman, having accomplished his part of the
  tragedy, Gordon's body was handed over to his friends. Chovell bled him,
  and the highwayman sighed deeply, but subsequently fainted and died. The
  want of success was attributed to the great weight of the culprit, who
  consequently dropped with unusual violence. (<i>Memoirs of the Royal
  Academy of Surgery in France</i>, Sydenham Society Publications, p.
  227.)</p>

  <p>How far the mechanical contrivance by which Bouthron, in Scott's
  <i>Fair Maid of Perth</i>, was kept alive after hanging, was founded on
  successful experience, I know not. Nor do I know whether Hook, in his
  <i>Maxwell</i>, had any farther authority than his imagination for his
  story of resuscitation, though I have heard it said to be founded on the
  supposed recovery of a distinguished forger, who had paid the last
  penalty for his offences, and who was said to have really died only a
  short time since.</p>

  <p class="address">Birmingham.</p>

  <p>The <i>Cork Remembrancer</i>, a chronicle of local events, which I
  recollect seeing among my late father's (a Cork man) books, relates the
  fact of a men who was hanged in that city, and on the evening of the same
  day appeared, not in the <i>spirit</i>, but in <i>body</i>, in the
  theatre. I regret I have not the book, but it is to be had somewhere.
  Undoubtedly your late venerable correspondent, James Roche, Esq., could
  have authenticated my statement, and with fuller particulars, as I only
  relate the record of it from memory, after a lapse of many years. I think
  the occurrence, of which there is no doubt, took place somewhere about
  the year 1782 or 1784; and after all there is nothing very extraordinary
  about it, for the mode of execution by hanging at that time presented
  many chances to the culprit of escaping death; he ascended a ladder, upon
  which he stood until all the arrangements were completed, and then was
  quietly turned off, commonly in such a manner as not to break the neck or
  hurt the spinal marrow. It was most likely so in the case I relate and
  the man having been suspended the usual time, and not having been a
  murderer, was handed over to his friends, who took prompt measures, and
  successfully, to restore animation, and so effectually, that the man,
  upon whom such little impression by the frightful ordeal he had passed
  was made, mixed in the world again, and was at the theatre that
  evening.</p>

  <p>Little chance is there of escaping death by the present mode of
  executing.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Umbra.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Dublin.</p>

  <p>The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. x. p. 570., after giving the
  names of those executed on Nov. 24, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And William Duell, for ravishing, robbing, and murdering Sarah
  Griffin at Acton. The body of this last was brought to Surgeons' Hall to
  be anatomised; but after it was stripped and laid on the board, and one
  of the servants was washing him in order to be cut, he perceived life in
  him, and found his breath to come quicker and quicker; on which a surgeon
  took some ounces of blood from him: in two hours he was able to sit up in
  his chair, and in the evening was again committed to Newgate."</p>

  <p>Other instances will be found in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol.
  i. p. 172., and vol. xxxvii. p. 90; and in vol. lxx. pt. i. p. 107. is
  the very curious case of Anne Green of Oxford, quoted from Dr. Plot's
  <i>Natural History of Oxfordshire</i>, p. 197., which is well worth
  reading. Also, in vol. lvii. pt. i. p. 33., is a letter, containing the
  two following quotations from Cardan, in explanation of the phenomenon of
  surviving death by hanging:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Is qui diu suspensus Bononi√¶ jacuit, vivus inventus est, quod asperam
  arteriam non cartilagineam sed osseam habuit."&mdash;<i>Cardanus</i>,
  lib. ii. tr. 2. contr. 7.</p>

  <p>"Constat quendam bis suspensum servatum miraculi specie; inde cum
  tertio Judicis solerti√¢ periisset, <!-- Page 282 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>{282}</span>inventam osseam asperam
  arteriam."&mdash;<i>Cardanus</i>, lib. xiv., De rerum variet., cap.
  76.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the <i>Newgate Calendar, or Malefactors' Bloody Register</i>, vol.
  ii. p. 233., is the account of Margaret Dickson, who was executed for
  child-murder at Edinburgh, June 19, 1728, with an engraving of her
  "rising from her coffin near Edinburgh, as she was carrying from the
  place of execution in order for interment."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"By the Scottish law," says the author, "every person on whom the
  judgment of the court has been executed has no more to suffer, but must
  be for ever discharged; and the executed person is dead at law, so that
  the marriage is dissolved. This was exactly the case with Margaret
  Dickson, for the king's advocate could not pursue her any farther, but
  filed a bill in the High Court of Justiciary against the sheriff for not
  seeing the judgment executed. And her husband being a good-natured man,
  was publicly married to her within a few days after the affair
  happened."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Zeus.</span></p>

  <p>For the information of your correspondent I send an extract from the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for February, 1767:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Saturday</i> 24th (Jan.).&mdash;One Patrick Redmond having been
  condemned at Cork, in Ireland, to be hanged for a street robbery, he was
  accordingly executed, and hung upwards of twenty-eight minutes, when the
  mob carried off the body to a place appointed, where he was, after five
  or six hours, actually recovered by a surgeon, and who made the incision
  in his windpipe called <i>bronchotomy</i>, which produced the desired
  effect. The poor fellow has since received his pardon, and a genteel
  collection has been made for him."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">C. R.</p>

  <p>I would refer your correspondent <span class="grk">&Sigma;</span>.,
  who has put a Query whether persons who have suffered execution by
  hanging have outlived the infliction, to a case of a woman named Anne
  Green, which appears to be authenticated upon the most unequivocal
  testimony of two very estimable authors. The event to which I allude is
  described in Dr. Robert Plot's <i>History of Oxfordshire</i>, folio,
  Oxford, 1705, p. 201.; and also in the <i>Physico-Theology</i> of Rev. W.
  Derham, F.R.S., 3rd edit., 8vo., London, 1714, p. 157. The
  above-mentioned Anne Green was executed at Oxford, December 14, 1650.</p>

  <p>I will not trespass upon your space, which appears pretty well
  occupied, with a lengthened detail from the authors pointed out, as their
  works are to be found in most libraries; and thinking Polonius's
  observation that "brevity is the soul of wit" may be more extensively
  applied than to what relates to fancy and imagination. I would, however,
  crave one word, which is, that you would suggest to your correspondents
  generally that in referring to works they would give, as distinctly as
  possible, the heads of the title, the name of the author, the edition, if
  more than one, the place of publication, date, and page. I have
  experienced much loss of time from incorrect and imperfect references,
  not to mention complete disappointment in many instances, which I trust

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>A Stereoscopic Note.</i>&mdash;I possess a small volume entitled
  <i>A Disquisition about the Final Causes of Natural Things</i>, by T. H.,
  B.B., Fellow of the Royal Society, 1688. "To which are subjoined, by way
  of Appendix, some uncommon observations about vitiated sight." In this
  strange appendix, one of the uncommon observations is worth the notice of
  your correspondents who write on stereoscopic subjects. I give you an
  extract from it:</p>

  <p>"It has been of late the opinion of very learned men, that though both
  our eyes are open, and turned towards an object, yet 'tis but one of them
  at a time that is effectually employed in giving us the representation of
  it: which opinion, in this place where I am writing but observations, it
  were not proper to discuss, especially because what is suppos'd to be
  observed will not always uniformly happen, but may vary in particular
  persons according to their several customs, and the constitution of their
  eyes: for I have, by an experiment purposely made, several times found,
  that my two eyes together see an object in another situation than either
  of them apart would do." And in giving instances for and against
  binocular vision, the author says: "A yet more considerable instance of
  such mistakes I afterwards had from a noble person, who, having in a
  fight, where he play'd the <i>hero</i>, had one of his eyes strangely
  shot out by a musquet bullet, that came out at his mouth, answered me,
  that not only he could not well pour drink out of one vessel into
  another, but had broken many glasses by letting them fall out of his
  hand, when he thought he had put them into another's, or set them down
  upon a table." The whole book is a very curious one, and I should be
  obliged if the Editor of "N. &amp; Q." could tell me who T. H. was?<a

  <p><i>Deepening Collodion Negatives.</i>&mdash;I have lately been trying
  a method of deepening collodion negatives, so as to render instantaneous
  impressions capable of being printed from, which I have found to answer
  admirably; <!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page283"></a>{283}</span>and although it is but a slight
  modification of <span class="sc">Mr. Lyte's</span> process described in
  "N. &amp; Q.," it is a very important one, and will be found to produce
  far better results. The picture having been developed in the usual way,
  with a solution of pyrogallic acid, is whitened by means of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Archer's</span> solution of bichloride of mercury. The
  plate is then washed with water and a solution of <i>iodide of
  cadmium</i> poured on. This converts the white chloride of mercury, which
  constitutes the picture, into the yellow iodide, in the same manner as
  the solution of iodide of potassium recommended by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Lyte</span>; but is much to be preferred, as it produces a more uniform
  deposit. The solution of iodide of potassium dissolves the iodide of
  mercury as soon as it is formed, and therefore cannot be left on the
  plate until the decomposition of the chloride is complete, without injury
  resulting to the picture, as the half-tones are thereby lost, and those
  parts over which the solution first flows become bleached before the
  other parts have attained their highest tone; whereas the solution of
  iodide of cadmium may be allowed to remain for any length of time on the
  plate, without any fear of its injuring the negative.</p>

  <p><i>Caution to Photographers.</i>&mdash;About six months since, I
  procured some gun cotton from a chemist which appeared very good, being
  quite soluble, and the collodion produced by it was excellent. That which
  I did not use I placed in what I believed to be a clean dry-stopped
  bottle, and put the bottle in a dark cupboard. I was much surprised the
  other day, upon going to the cupboard, to find the stopper blown out, and
  the cotton giving out dense red fumes of nitrous acid. It appears to me
  to be almost upon the point of combustion, and I have, accordingly,
  placed it under a bell-glass in a porcelain dish to watch the result. I
  feel satisfied, however, that there is some risk, and, as it may often be
  near ether, spirits of wine, or other inflammable chemicals, that caution

  <p><i>Artesian Wells</i> (Vol. ix., p.222.).&mdash;Wells are often so
  called without just pretence to a similarity with those in Artois, whence
  this name is derived. There are some natural springs in the northern
  slope of the chalk in Lincolnshire, near the Humber, called
  <i>blow-wells</i>, which may be considered naturally Artesian. The
  particular character by which an Artesian well may be known is, that the
  water, if admitted into a tube, will rise above the level of the ground
  in its immediate vicinity up to the level of its sources in the basin of
  the district; this basin being usually gravel, lying betwixt two strata
  impervious to water, formed the surrounding hills, and extending often
  over many miles of the earth's surface. If we conceive the figure of a
  large bowl, inclosing a somewhat smaller one, the interstice being filled
  with gravel, and the rain falling on the earth being collected within
  such interstice, then this interstice being tapped by boring a well, the
  water will rise up from the well to the same height as it stands in the
  interstice, or rim of the natural basin. Such is an Artesian well.
  Supposing this huge mineral double bowl to be broken by a geological
  <i>fault</i>, the same hydrostatic principle will act similarly.</p>

  <p>The question of <i>preferable</i> put by <span
  class="sc">Stylites</span> must be governed by the <i>cui bono</i>.
  Universal adoption is forbidden, first, by the absence of a gravelly
  stratum betwixt two strata impervious to water; and secondly, by the
  excessive expense of boring to such great depths. Where expense is not in
  excess of the object to be attained, and where the district is
  geologically favourable, the Artesian wells are preferable to common ones
  derived from natural tanks or water caverns, first, for the superabundant
  supply; secondly, for the height to which the water naturally rises above
  the ground; and thirdly, because boring Artesian wells, properly so
  called, does not rob a neighbour's well for your own benefit, afterwards
  to be lost when any neighbour chooses to dig a little deeper than you.
  This is a matter with which London brewers are familiar.</p>

  <p><i>Handwriting</i> (Vol. viii., p. 639.).&mdash;In your concluding
  Number of last year, E. B. requested information as to any work in
  English, French, German, or Spanish, giving a standard alphabet for the
  various kinds of writing now in use, with directions for teaching the
  same. I fear I shall not satisfy all your correspondent's inquiries; but
  the following may be of some service. I have in my possession a German
  work, nearly of the kind he requires. The title is, <i>Gr√ºndliche
  Anweisung zum Sch√∂nschreiben</i>, by Martin Sch√ºssler, Wiesbaden, 1820.
  It is of an oblong shape, and consists entirely of engraved plates, in
  number thirty-two. It begins with some directions for the form <!-- Page
  284 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284"></a>{284}</span>and
  inclination of letters; then follows an explanation of five rules for
  writing, which are given in the German handwriting. After exhausting the
  German, the author proceeds to English letters and handwriting, followed
  by engrossing hand. Then he gives the <i>fractur</i>, or black-letter
  characters, with some elaborate and beautiful capitals. He next gives
  specimens of French handwriting, and ends with Greek current hand, and
  plates of large capitals of ornamental patterns; all different.</p>

  <p>If this work would at all answer the purpose of E. B., and he would
  wish to see it, it shall be sent to him by post on his giving his address
  to the writer, whose card is enclosed.</p>

  <i>The Arte of Logike, plainelie set foorth in our English Tongue, easie

  passage:</p>

  <p><i>When and where does Sunday begin or end?</i> (Vol. ix., p.
  198.).&mdash;The Christian festival, commonly called Sunday, named by the
  ancient church "The Lord's Day," because that thereon the resurrection
  was accomplished, and the new creation, the work of Messias, commenced,
  this feast, I say, begins at six o'clock in the evening of Saturday, the
  last day of the week, at the close of that Hebrew fast; and the end of
  Sunday arrives at six o'clock in the evening of that first day of the
  week. When time was measured out, the count began with "the evening,"
  which was created first; and which, with the succeeding morning, reckoned
  as the first day.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. of Morwenstow.</span></p>

  <p>This question has been, to a certain extent, before debated by Mr.
  Johnson in his addenda to his <i>Clergyman's Vade Mecum</i>, pp. 106,
  107., and <i>Ecclesiastical Law</i>, as quoted by Wheatly, who combated
  his reasoning of Sunday beginning at six o'clock on the Saturday evening.
  Johnson rests his argument upon Deuteronomy xvi. 6., where the sacrifice
  of the passover is ordered "at even, on the going down of the sun;" upon
  Exodus xii. 6., where the whole "congregation of Israel shall kill it in
  the evening;" and I think he might have also taken Genesis i. 5., "And
  the evening and the morning were the first day." Johnson says that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Church of England has divided her nights and days according to
  the Scriptural, not the civil account: and that though our civil day
  begins from midnight, yet our ecclesiastical day begins at six in the
  evening.... The proper time for vesper, or evening song, is six of the
  clock, and from that time the religious day begins."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Wheatly admits that "the festival is not past till evensong is ended,"
  but does not agree to its commencing on the preceding evensong; for if it
  does, he cannot reconcile the rubric at the end of the Table of
  Vigils.</p>

  <p>On the whole, I think Johnson has the best of the argument: and that
  Sunday begins ecclesiastically at six in the evening on Saturday;
  civilly, at midnight.</p>

  of intelligence in every new lord mayor. Arms he supposed it had, and
  long ones too, for it could reach at anything. Legs, of course, when it
  made such long strides. A throat to swallow the rights of the community,
  and a stomach to digest them! But who ever yet discovered, in the anatomy

  <p><i>Member of Parliament electing Himself</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  536.).&mdash;In the article forwarded by H. M. are many gross errors.
  William M&lsquo;Leod Bannatyne, Esq., was Sheriff of Buteshire from Dec.
  22, 1775, till May 28, 1799; during which period there were only two
  county elections in Buteshire, viz. April 22, 1784, and June 27, 1796
  (the counties of Bute and Caithness being represented only in alternate
  parliaments), and on <i>neither</i> of those occasions was he the
  <i>sole</i> freeholder present. The statement in question can therefore
  only refer to the election on Nov. 13, 1806, when, owing to some
  accidental circumstances, he was the only freeholder present. In 1799 he
  was raised to the Bench of the Court of Session by the title of Lord
  Bannatyne; and consequently he neither <i>did</i> nor <i>could</i> act as
  sheriff seven years after he ceased to hold that office. It is true that,
  as a technical formality, he nominated himself chairman of the meeting to
  enable him to sign the minute of the election in that capacity; but it is
  <i>not true</i> that he either administered the oaths to himself, or
  signed the return of the election as sheriff. I was then a lad, and was
  present as a spectator on that occasion, when I saw Mr. Blain the
  sheriff-substitute administer the oaths to Lord Bannatyne; and, of
  course, Mr. Blain also made the election return, certifying that "the
  Honorable James Stuart Wortley Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, &amp;c. (a
  relation of the family of Bute) had been duly elected." Thus you see that
  the title of the article is quite erroneous, and is not even borne out by
  the original account, as the freeholder did not elect <i>himself</i>, but
  another person; and he did not act in any other capacity than that of a
  freeholder: the case being extraordinary enough of only <i>one</i>
  freeholder attending at a county election, without the addition of those
  marvellous circumstances.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Anthony Fitzherbert not Chief Justice</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 576.

  M. W. R. proposes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But here our author objects against himself: That once upon a time
  the archbishop called a synod by his own authority, without the king's
  licence; and was thereupon prohibited by Fitzherbert, Lord Chief Justice;
  but the archbishop regarded not his prohibition. What this is to his
  purpose I cannot tell, nor do I see wherefore he brought it in, unless it
  were to blame Rolle for quoting Speed for it. And therefore, in behalf of
  both, I shall take the liberty to say thus much. That I know not what
  harm it is for a man in his own private collections&mdash;for such
  Rolle's <i>Abridgment</i> was, though afterwards thought worthy of a
  public view&mdash;to note a memorable passage of history, and make a
  remark of his own upon it, out of one of the most faithful and judicious
  of all our modern historians.</p>

  <p>"I have before taken notice of this passage, and that not from Speed,
  but from Roger Hoveden; from <!-- Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page286"></a>{286}</span>whom I suppose Speed may also have taken
  the relation. I shall therefore only beg to set this gentleman, to whom
  all our historians are I doubt equally unknown, right in two particulars;
  by telling him, that <i>neither was Fitzherbert the man who prohibited
  the archbishop, neither was he Chief Justice when he did it. His name was
  Geoffrey Fitz-Peter.</i> He was Earl of Essex, and a very eminent man in
  those days; and his place was much greater than this author represents
  it; even Lord Justice of England, which he was first made by King
  Richard, anno 1198; and held in the King's absence to his death, anno
  1213; in which year King John, going over into France, constituted Peter,
  Bishop of Winchester, Lord Justice in his place."&mdash;Wake's

  any church wardens or bricklayers of the nineteenth century. Several
  writs of Henry III. are extant, directing the Norman Chapel in the Tower
  to be whitewashed. Westminster Hall was whitewashed for the coronation of
  Edward I.; and many other ancient examples might be cited. In fact it
  seems to have been the rule to plaster ordinary
  stonework."&mdash;<i>Domestic Architecture in England</i>, p. xxvi.</p>

  is quite wrong as to the date of this building. The nave is separated
  from the north and south aisles by an arcade of five arches of undoubted
  Middle Pointed work; not later than the beginning of the fourteenth
  century, to which date also belongs the east window of the chancel: the
  "clere-story," which has the device of a rose and wing (not <i>ring</i>),
  is probably of the date assigned to the whole church by your
  correspondent. The south aisle was much altered about forty years ago,
  the windows of which are a bad imitation of those in the north aisle. In
  making alterations to the chancel in 1852 the piscina, and a portion of
  the sedilia, a drawing of which is given in <i>The Builder</i>, vol. x.
  p. 797., with a window over, were brought to light. They belong to the
  First Pointed period, or about the latter part of the twelfth century;
  clearly showing that a portion, at least, of the church is of the
  last-mentioned date.</p>

  <p>I have always understood that the wing and rose, on the walls of the
  clere-story, was the cognizance of Abbot Wingrose of Waltham.</p>

  <p><i>Coin of Carausius</i> (Vol. ix., p. 148).&mdash;C. G. is right in
  considering his coin as of Carausius, who reigned from 1040 to 1046 <span
  class="sm">A.U.C.</span> I would suggest <span class="sm">P. F.</span>
  for Pius Felix, as preferable to <span class="sm">P. P.</span></p>

  <p>The dates will show that the letters <span class="sm">MLXXI</span>
  have nothing to do with the year 1071. On other coins of Carausius we
  find the signs <span class="sm">ML</span>, <i>Moneta Londinensis</i>, or
  <i>Moneta Londini</i> (<i>percussa</i>); and <span class="sm">MSL</span>,
  <i>Moneta signata Londini</i>. These interpretations are justified by
  analogy with the Roman coins, and by the signs on coins of Constantine,
  <span class="sm">MSL</span>, which must be interpreted as on the coins of
  Carausius, <span class="sm">MLON</span>, and <span class="sm">MLN</span>,
  <i>Moneta Londini</i> (<i>percussa</i>). The abbreviation <span
  class="sm">LN</span> for <span class="sm">LON</span> is analogous to
  <span class="sm">RV</span> for <i>Ravenna</i>, which is undoubted.</p>

  <p>As for the letters <span class="sm">XXI</span>, they occur very
  frequently, either alone or with others, on coins of Aurelian and his
  successors. They have evidently relation to the value of the coin, and
  are replaced by the Greek letters <span class="scac"><span title="KA" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&Alpha;</span></span>, which have the same numerical value, on
  coins of Diocletian, &amp;c. As analogous signs, I may quote <span
  class="sm">LXXII</span> and <span class="sm">OB</span>, the corresponding
  Greek letters, on amei respectively of Constantine and Valentinian,
  showing the <i>ameus</i> = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">72</span> of a pound; <span class="sm">LX</span> on silver
  coins of Constantius = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">60</span> of a pound; and <span class="sm">XCVI</span> on
  denarii of Diocletian = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">96</span> of a pound.</p>

  <p>It has not yet been explained, however, in what relation these copper
  coins stood to the others, so as to justify the <span
  class="sm">XXI</span>, unless Mommsen may have done so in a book I have
  not seen, <i>Ueber den Verfall des M√ºnzwesens in der Kaiserzeit</i>,
  1851. See for the particulars of the above-cited coins, Pinder and
  Friedl√§nder's <i>Beitr√§ge zur M√ºnzkunde</i>, p. 17. and following.</p>

  <p><i>Views in London by Canaletto</i> (Vol. ix., p. 106.).&mdash;In
  reply to the Query of your correspondent <span class="sc">Gondola</span>,
  I beg to say that I have long had the pleasure of possessing one of
  Canaletto's London views, that of the Thames from the Temple Gardens, in
  which the hand that painted gondolas and masks may be traced in Thames
  wherries and grave Templars. I believe there are others in the
  collections of the Dukes of Buccleugh and Northumberland.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Edmund Phipps.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Park Lane.</p>

  <p>During the residence of Antonio Canaletto at Venice, he painted a
  number of pictures, at low prices, for Joseph Smith, Esq., the British
  consul; but that gentleman retailed those paintings at an enormous profit
  to English travellers. Canaletto finding this out, was induced to visit a
  country where his talents were so much appreciated. He accordingly came
  to England in the year 1746, being then about fifty years of age. He
  remained with us six or seven years (not <i>two</i>, as stated by
  Walpole), and during that period received great encouragement from the
  English nobility. His delineations of London and its environs, especially
  those of Thames scenery (of which he seems to have been very fond), are
  deservedly admired. Two of these are at Goodwood, and another (Parliament
  Street, looking towards Charing Cross) is in the Buccleuch Collection.
  Several London paintings were, at the beginning of the present century,
  in the possession of the Hon. Percy Wyndham. Some others are to be found
  in the royal collections, and in those of many noblemen and gentlemen of
  fortune.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>When Dr. Ure tells us that from the year 1804, when he conducted the
  schools of chemistry and manufactures in the Andersonian Institution, up
  to the present day, he has been assiduously engaged in the study and
  improvement of most of the chemical, and many of the mechanical, arts;
  that during that period he has been habitually consulted professionally
  by proprietors of factories, workshops, and mines, to rectify what was
  amiss in their establishments, and to supply what was wanting, he shows
  clearly how great were his qualifications for the preparation of <i>A
  Dictionary of Arts, Manufactures, and Mines, containing a clear
  exposition of their principles and practice</i>: and it is therefore
  little wonder that a work undertaken with such advantages should have
  reached what is now before us, a "fourth edition, corrected and greatly
  enlarged." Dr. Ure has, in this edition, turned to good account the many
  novelties of an interesting and useful nature first displayed in the
  Great Exhibition, and his two portly volumes may be consulted with
  advantage not only by manufacturers and professional men, but by lawyers,
  legislators, and, in short, all who take an interest in those
  achievements of science to which this great country owes its
  pre-eminence.</p>

  <p>Unnoticed by reviewers, and unaided by favour or influence, Mr.
  Keightley tells us that his <i>Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy</i>
  has reached its third edition. So much the better, for it proves that the
  book has merits of its own, and those merits have won for it a place
  which will keep Mr. Keightley's name in memory as long as a love for
  classical literature and tasteful learning remains; and this, we suspect,
  will be longer than Mr. Keightley anticipates. As the success which has
  attended this valuable and original exposition of classical mythology
  renders it unnecessary to say one word as to its merits, we may content
  ourselves with stating that this edition has been carefully revised, has
  received numerous additions, and, although it is beautifully got up, is
  published at lower price than its predecessor. <!-- Page 289 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>{289}</span></p>

  <p>The children of Lady Falmouth are blessed with a mother who possesses
  that invaluable gift, the art of making learning a pleasure; and we doubt
  not many a loving mother will be glad to find her labours lightened by
  the recently published <i>Conversations on Geography, or the Child's
  first introduction to where He is, what He is, and what else there
  is</i>, by Viscountess Falmouth, Baroness Le Despencer. These
  conversations strongly remind one of Mrs. Marcet's, and we can give them
  no higher praise.</p>

  <p>Whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the partial or
  impartial character of M. de Custine's work upon <i>Russia</i>, it
  contains much matter which will be read at the present important crisis
  with considerable interest; and in reprinting it in their <i>Traveller's
  Library</i>, at a price which will place it within the reach of all
  classes of readers, Messrs. Longman have taken steps for securing to
  <i>Russia by</i> M. De Custine a wide-spread popularity.</p>

  <p>Our valued correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> has kindly
  sent us a copy of a little offering to the manes of Shakspeare and Tieck,
  of which he has printed a few copies for private distribution. It is
  <i>The Midsummer Night, or Shakspeare and the Fairies, from the German of
  Ludwig Tieck</i>, by Mary C. Rumsay. The work, one of exuberant fancy,
  was written when Tieck was only sixteen, but only published by his friend
  Bulow in 1851. It is translated with great ability; and we regret, for
  the sake of the many who would wish to possess it, that <span
  class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> did not carry out his original intention,
  and publish it in aid of the funds for the monument to Tieck.</p>

  <p><i>The Journal of Classical and Sacred Philology</i>, No. I., March,
  1854, is the first of a very valuable periodical, the nature and object
  of which are plainly indicated by its title. One very useful feature is
  its <i>Contents of Foreign Journals</i>, in which it records all the
  important contributions on sacred and classical philology inserted in the
  chief periodicals of the Continent.</p>

  <p>We have before us the publications of <i>The Arundel Society</i>, or
  <i>Society for Promoting the Knowledge of the Fine Arts</i>, for the
  fourth year: and they are indeed of a nature to effect the great object
  for which the Society was instituted. They consist of eight engravings on
  wood from drawings made by Mr. Williams, who was sent by the Society to
  Padua expressly for the purpose, from the frescos of Giotto in the Arena
  Chapel. The woodcuts have been executed by Messrs. Dalziel. With the rest
  of these prints will be issued a short description of the chapel and its
  frescos, prepared by Mr. Ruskin.</p>

  <p>The Second Part of Mr. Netherclift's <i>Autograph Miscellany</i>
  contains fac-similes of the original depositions of their marriage by
  James II. and Anne Hyde; of an original letter from Luther to Cromwell,
  afterwards Earl of Essex; of a letter from Glover, Somerset Herald, to
  the Earl of Leicester; and of that portion of Sterne's <i>Sentimental
  Journey</i> in which is related the episode of "The Dead Ass."</p>

  <p>The success which has attended the publication of Miss Burney's
  <i>Diary</i>, or, to give the work its more correct title, <i>The Diary
  and Letters of Madame D'Arblay</i>, has induced Mr. Colburn to commence a
  new edition of it in seven three-shilling volumes.</p>
